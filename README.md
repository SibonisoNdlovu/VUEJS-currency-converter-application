Thank you very much for the opportunity to do this assessment.
It was very much challenging but managed to try my best to produce something that is working.

This was my first VUEjs project and it took some time upskilling and trying to understand everything.

After pressing buttions there is a 3-5 seconds lag as I did not have time to add a loader

The tests are not included as I did not get to completing that part of the assessment
